      Mihama Academy is a prison-like school built to preserve "fruit" that has fallen too far from its tree. It is home to five female students who each have their own reasons for enrolling in the academy and live their life idly within the walls of Mihama. One day, Kazami Yuuji—the institute's first male student—arrives and throws the orderly rhythm of Mihama off balance. Is Yuuji what the girls need to grab hold of their lives once more, or will the weight of their pasts prove too steep a wall to overcome? Or, is his past even heavier than any of the others?          </font><</font></p>

    <div class="side1"><font size="5"><font color= "white">Takizono Gakuen Maikurobasu Tenraku Jiko was an event that happened on August 14th, 2005, at 11:52 A.M. The bus, full of members of the Takizono Academy Basketball Club and driven by the club's advisor Yoshihiko Ochi, was on the way back from a summer training camp on a back road when Ochi lost control of the bus and drove it off of a cliff. The bus hit the bottom and was thrown on its side. Tomoe Okabe and Youko Ozawa were killed instantly. Tsukasa Shikanai was killed from a head injury ten minutes later, moaning in pain the entire time. The others injured in the initial fall were Tamaki Hirooka, who broke both of her legs, Saaya Kaneda, who suffered a laceration to the head, Mifuyu Sakurai, who received a gash to her abdomen from a sharp object, and Yoshihiko Ochi, who was knocked unconscious. They had landed in a crevice next to a heavily overgrown forest with no signs of obvious animal life. It was believed to be the site of a meteorite impact long ago, leaving the area high metallic and magnetic, thus rendering nearby compasses useless. The area was out of range of cell phone service and cars rarely came by the road they drove on. The forest would take many days to go through and because of how overgrown it was a person could be easily lost and end up never finding their way back without a compass. Shortly after the crash, Amane Suou woke up to find herself on top of Kazuki Kazami. After exiting the crashed bus, the two helped get everyone out. Kazuki made Amane her friend and ally quickly. Kazuki started asking odd questions to test Amane. Amane quickly became confused by her new friend, but knew she was safest around her.</p>

    <p class="pos_right"><font size="5"><font color= "white">Kazami Yūji is a second-year student at Mihama Academy and the protagonist of Grisaia no Kajitsu. Also known as "Ace number 9029", Yuuji is an assassin for a Japanese government agency, a black ops employed by Ichigaya. Growing tired of his aimless existence, he desires a normal school life. Cool, philosophical, and minimalist, Yuuji maintains a realistic outlook on life. He views himself as cowardly as he always plans and scouts before taking action. Other than his occasional orthodontic military methods, he is a fit young man disguised as an “exchange student from Canada” of his new school, Mihama Academy.

          <h6 class="panel">A second year at Mihama Academy, and daughter of "East Beach Railway Express Group" tycoon Michiaki Sakaki. Yumiko was the first student enrolled at Mihama Academy. Due to her blunt personality and troubled past, she associates poorly with strangers. Always trying to be alone, she hardly meets with the others. She always carries a box cutter with her and use it to threaten others when she's getting angry. She reads so many books that she’s called a "Bookworm," especially, mystery novel is her favorite. Although she's such a lady, she changes completely in meal time. Junk foods like a cup of fried soba noodles is her favorite dish.

          <h6 class="panel">A 2nd year student of Mihama academy, a fake tsundere with bleached blond twin tail. She has a deep interest in tsundere character and tries to act like one. Her silly and energetic personality makes her become the mood maker of the class. Her study grades are bad. She always carries with her a shark-shaped pouch which contains lemonade sweets. Despite having difficulty with sour foods, she still drinks 100% pure Vitamin C in order to "improve her intelligence," as she said. She has encountered lots of bad luck since her birth but always manages to get through them in one way or another.

          <h6 class="panel">A 1st year student of Mihama Academy, as well as the self-appointed maid of the academy. Other than when she is taking a bath, or swimming, she always wears maid uniform. This is a result of her friends (jokingly) telling her she "should wear the maid uniform as much as possible." She has a tendency to take anything and everything said to her completely seriously, and whenever someone tasks her with something she will stop at no lengths to satisfy that demand. Often the result of her practically autonomous level of "obedience" is she will get herself into serious trouble. Her favorite animal is the shark.

          <h6 class="panel">First grader of Mihama academy, an innocent and carefree girl. For some unexplainable reasons, it's hard to understand her personality. In general, she can be explained in one word, "Fool," but sometime her speeches and behaviors make people shed cold sweat. For that uniqueness, most of people who talk with her for five minutes will say "This girl is awful." She adores Yuuji as a brother and Amane as a sister. She calls Yuuji "Onii-chan." Although she has her own room in the dormitory, she always stays in Amane's room. She always wears knee-socks with two different colors. Because of her parents work, she stayed in foreign countries until she was six so she can speak English.</h6>

          <h6 class="panel">Third grade of Mihama Academy, the onee-san type who always takes care of others. For some circumstances, she skipped one school year at her previous school, so she is actually two years older than Yuuji. She is tall and has a good body style. Her family manages a long-established restaurant in Ginza, so she is good at cooking. Because her mother comes from Kyoto, when getting excited or panic, she sometimes talks in Kansai dialect. She has a deep interest in cars and has acquired automatic two-wheeled vehicle license. She has a dirt bike which was remodeled to a cruiser called "Boba Tarou" and is put in the garage of the academy.</h6>

          <h6 class="panel">Kazuki is Yuuji's elder sister as well as the one who taught him throughout the earlier periods of his life. Contrary to the norm, Kazuki was the center pillar of the family instead of her father. She was the one earning all the living expenses and no one could go against her. Despite her delicate and diminutive body, she has brilliant intellect and excels in quick-witted judgement to the point that she has been labelled as a genius. She is the same age as Amane, both of which attended the same school "Takizono Private" and was also an active member of the basketball team for the aforementioned academy.</h6>
