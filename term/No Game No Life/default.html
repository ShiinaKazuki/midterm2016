    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>No Game No Life is a surreal comedy that follows Sora and Shiro, shut-in NEET siblings and the online gamer duo behind the legendary username "Kuuhaku." They view the real world as just another lousy game; however, a strange e-mail challenging them to a chess match changes everything—the brother and sister are plunged into an otherworldly realm where they meet Tet, the God of Games. The mysterious god welcomes Sora and Shiro to Disboard, a world where all forms of conflict—from petty squabbles to the fate of whole countries—are settled not through war, but by way of high-stake games. This system works thanks to a fundamental rule wherein each party must wager something they deem to be of equal value to the other party's wager. In this strange land where the very idea of humanity is reduced to child’s play, the indifferent genius gamer duo of Sora and Shiro have finally found a real reason to keep playing games: to unite the sixteen races of Disboard, defeat Tet, and become the gods of this new, gaming-is-everything world.</p>

He is the main male protagonist of No Game, No Life and the cunning and manipulative half of the siblings. He has a lackadaisical hate towards life and is pretty much dedicated only to gaming. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world after they defeated Tet in chess. Sora's biological father (no relation to Shiro) married Shiro's biological mother (no relation to Sora), thus making Shiro and Sora only step-siblings.</h6>

          <h6 class="panel">Stephanie Dola is the granddaughter of the former king of Imanity. After the king's death, she gambled to become the next queen of the country. Although she was forced by the pledges to fall in love with Sora after losing a game to him in Episode 02, she has since developed feelings for him despite denying these feelings on a consistent basis. In the short story, Steph actually lost a bit of her mind when she was defeated by Sora again and again.</h6>

          <h6 class="panel">Jibril is the youngest and strongest of the Flügel race. Her love toward knowledge started even before the declaration of the Ten Oaths. She is against the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left Avant Heim, her homeland, to win the National Library of Elchea from the previous king in a game. When Sora heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and Shiro's servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she now must share it with the rest of Imanity. Jibril thus took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans. Unlike Steph, Jibril is happy to become the siblings' underling, and is shown to have grown feelings toward Sora.</h6>

This was due to her belief that humans will never be strong enough and must depend on others in order to survive. She is the friend of the elven girl Fiel Nirvalen, despite being a slave of Fiel's family. After Sora bet the Race Piece of Imanity in their game with the Eastern Union, Kurami challenged Sora in an attempt to win the Race Piece. However, Sora, as he was challenged and thus had the right to choose the game, chose a game in which they would both bet everything they have in parts, tricked her into sharing his memory's with her. After Sora won the game, he returned all memories to the respective owners. After Kurami had seen Sora's memory's, she decided to go along with him and his plan.</h6>

Despite her young physical appearance, she is actually around 52 years old. It is subsequently revealed that Kurami is actually her family's slave. Despite this, they hold a close relationship between each other. She even begs Sora to restore Kurami's memories after the latter won them in a game. Believing that Sora's going to fulfill his words to unite all races, she now works with Kurami to claim the leadership of Elves as she cares more about Kurami than her own race.</h6>

After Sora and Shiro forced the werebeasts to join the Elkia Federation, Izuna was directed by Miko to follow and learn from them. Sora and Shiro have a habit of petting her fur yet she seems to enjoy it (much to the chagrin of her grandfather). Steph has noted that she actually shares similarities to Sora and Shiro, such as lacking common sense, being arrogant towards others, and being extremely smart and competent at gaming.</h6>

Thus her current namesake is usually written in brackets. She looked down on Imanity at first, but after forming a truce with Sora and joining the Elchea Federation, she starts to have faith in the siblings who represent Imanity. She also ordered Izuna and Ino to follow Sora and Shiro, believing that both can learn more from the siblings.</h6>
