Are they really just going to bury their heads in the sand and let the world change around them? And are they really willing to let the man who changed their lives slip away without so much as trying to win him back? As the end of their time at Mihama Academy approaches, Amane, Makina, Sachi, Yumiko, and Michiru find themselves arriving at a single conclusion. One thing is for certain, though - the girls of Mihama are no longer willing to let the world steal things away from them without at least a bit of resistance first.

Despite her delicate and diminutive body, she is so intelligent that she can be called a genius. She is the same age as Amane and both of them went to the same school, “Takizono Private Academy”, and were in the basketball team of the school. She "died" in an bus accident which greatly influences Yuuji's and Amane's future life.</p>

She had died a year before Yuuji enrolled in Mihama Academy. After her death, her friend, JB, became Yuuji’s guardian. Yuuji once said “She had a rough personality”. She is now cremated and has her grave stone on the mountains in Yamanashi Prefecture alongside John where she and Yuuji used to live. Harudera Yuria(right) is Yuuji's guardian and superior, also case officer at Ichigaya. Her former name is Julia Bardera but she changed it after moving to Japan and that’s why Yuuji calls her JB. Though she looks like an American, she is a mixed-blood between German and Italian.</p>
          <img alt="" src="Pictures/image9.jpg" style="width:600px"/>
          <p>After her "death", her mind was intergrated with the Thanatos System by CIRS. Later on, it was found that she has a body, that seems to be functional. She pulls all the strings in Yuuji's rescue plan.</br>

            <h5 class="subheader">How much a group of students can do in the face of countries and organizations far bigger than any individual could hope to be remains to be seen. In the first place, Yuuji's position is far more complicated than any of them could have imagined, as he finds himself embroiled in an elaborate game of super-political chess revolving around both himself and an inconceivable new system slumbering in the depths of CIRS—a system that Yuuji may have more of a connection to than he thinks. The story picks up immediately after the events of Grisaia no Meikyuu, with Kazami Yuuji having been detained for suspected involvement with an international terrorist organization, lead by Heath Oslo, that has managed to enter Japan's borders with a devastating new weapon of mass destruction in hand. </h5>

Before being recruited in the military, she forced herself as a prostitute in order to comply with her basic needs. She was rejected by Yuuji before taking his leave from the US Army to return to Japan. One of the two people "Thanatos" requests assistance from to play a back-up role in Yuuji's rescue plan.</h5>
